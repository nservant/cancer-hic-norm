Normalization of cancer Hi-C data

The project contains the scripts used in the manuscript : "Effective normalization for copy number variation in Hi-C data. Servant N, Varoquaux N, Heard E, Vert JP, Barillot E."

All results and data used in the publication are available at http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~nvaroquaux/normalization/

The sources are organized as follow :  
- simulation_model

Contains the script to simulation cancer Hi-C data from diploid real Hi-C data

- cnv_from_hic

Contains the script to infer the CNV profile from any Hi-C dataset

- LOIC_normalization  
- CAIC_normalization
