This document describes how to run the LOIC / CAIC normalizations method implemented in the [iced](https://pypi.org/project/iced/#files) python package


# Python wrapper

The ice_cnv.py script allows to run the LOIC/CAIC normalization on Hi-C data generated by the HiC-Pro pipeline

python ice_cnv.py -h

# Python API

### Importing packages
+ **datasets** contains dataset example to practice 
+ **normalizations** contains normalization functions
+ **io** contains methods for loading and managing sparse data

```python
from iced import datasets
from iced import normalization
from iced import io
```


### Data loading
3 data files are needed to process CAIC normalization 

+ **counts** : count matrix can be in sparse format or matrix format
+ **lengths** : array with each chromosome length
+ **cnv** : smooth profil line array (for each bin) generated with `segment_hic_data.sh` (*file_seg.bed* $4^{th}$ column)
 
```python
counts, lengths, cnv = datasets.load_sample_cancer()

counts = io.load_counts(mat, lengths=None)
```

### ICE Normalization
To compute ICE, provide the **counts** matrix
```python
ice_normed = normalization.ICE_normalization(counts, counts_profile=None)
```

### LOIC Normalization
To compute LOIC Normalization, function requires to provide the profil line **cvn** and the matrix **counts** 
```python
loic_normed = normalization.ICE_normalization(counts, counts_profile=cnv)
```

### CAIC Normalization
CAIC Normalization requires to compute LOIC Normalization before. 
Then, call *estimate_block_biases* with **counts** matrix, chr **lengths** file and **cnv** profile line.
Final step is to divide, **loic_normed** matrix by the **block bias** matrix estimated
```python
loic_normed = normalization.ICE_normalization(counts, counts_profile=cnv)
block_biases = normalization.estimate_block_biases(counts, lengths, cnv)
caic_normed = loic_normed / block_biases
```
